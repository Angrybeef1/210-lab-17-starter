What to submit: a GitHub repository URL with an invitation to prof.deets.

Here's the starter codeLinks to an external site. for linked lists that I provided in this module. This links to my GitHub repository. Fork this repository to your own account (follow the forking procedures in this module). Edit it freely for the assignment. When you're done, push your changes to your repository and submit your URL.

Refactor this code. The code currently is not modular at all; important code that could be reused is not contained in functions.

Rewrite the code such that it leverages functions to perform these linked list operations: adding a node to the front; adding a node to the tail; deleting a node; inserting a node; and deleting the entire linked list.

Don't forget that the coding conventions for this course have been updated and now require using function prototypes.




Not sure if you will read this, I had some issues with this and questions...The random number generations always seems to pull the same numbers.
